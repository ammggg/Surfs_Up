Surf's Up
---------

Overview
--------
This analysis was meant to explore a business opportunity for a surf and shake shop.

Results
-------
* Although there are more observations for the month of June, the average temperatures for June and December are 75 and 71 degrees farenheit, respecitvely.
* There is also very similar variation in the temperature data itself with the June standard deviation of 3.3 degrees versus the December standard deviation of 3.7 degrees.
* Oddly enough, the max temperatures for the two months are 85 and 83 degrees farenheit for June and December, respectively.

Summary
-------
Overall, there is not much variation in temperature data when comparing June versus December. Two additional queries that may shed some more light would be:
* To overlay the precipitation data against the temperatures for those two months to see if there is any notable variation in rainfall during these two periods. 
* Since this new business venture would be very dependent on tourism, I would also want to have tourist data to analyze how the tourism industry differs during these two months. This would provide further insight into the feasability of this business and the effects of seasonality on tourist traffic.
